I leanred that the readme.md file was all caps. 

The elastic IP address for startup is 34.232.133.172

ssh -i C:\Users\18jab\CS260\Production.pem ubuntu@bakecs260.click

Deploy Files Command: ./deployFiles.sh -k ../production.pem -h bakecs260.click -s startup

3rd party server is when I get info from another website and use it in mine.

Websocket is the connection to each device that is using my website
    - the lists under the month name is the information that I will be getting from the websocket interaction.

My third Party service calls will be the current date and time displayed on the top of the screen.

#px is a small measurement of distance on the screen and the #em is a larger type of measurement.


There is a part of code that makes the sections spaced in a certain way. 
    section:nth-child(1) {
        flex: 1;
        background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
    }
    section:nth-child(2) {
        flex: 3;
        background-color: white;
    }
    section:nth-child(3){
        flex: 1;
        background-color: rgb(220, 202, 0);
    }


    
    You can also add middleware for handling errors that occur. Error middleware looks similar to other middleware functions, but it takes an additional err parameter that contains the error.

function errorMiddlewareName(err, req, res, next)
If you wanted to add a simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while processing HTTP requests you could add the following.

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});
We can test that our error middleware is getting used by adding a new endpoint that generates an error.

app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});
Now if we use curl to call our error endpoint we can see that the response comes from the error middleware.

âžœ curl localhost:8080/error
{"type":"Error","message":"Trouble in river city"}
