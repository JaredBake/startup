There is a part of code that makes the sections spaced in a certain way.

        flex: 1;
        background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
    }
    section:nth-child(2) {
        flex: 3;
        background-color: white;
    }
    section:nth-child(3){
        flex: 1;
        background-color: rgb(220, 202, 0);
    }
